# Snippets Addin Change Log

### 0.3
<i><small>Jan. 30th, 2017</small></i>

* **Run and Test Buttons**  
Added **Run Snippet** and **Test Snippet** buttons to the toolbar to allow obvious ways to run and test the selected snippet. Snippets can be executed via the toolbar button, by pressing Enter, Space, or by double clicking the Snippet. Testing can only be performed via the Test button.

* **Fix ListBox focus on Launch**  
Fixed the form's focus so that it is initially focused on the listbox, ready to type a few letters to jump to the appropriate snippet to embed.
